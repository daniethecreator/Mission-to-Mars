# Mission-to-Mars

Pulled data from NASA Mars website into a new webpage that was interactive and able to pull updated data with a click of a button. The data included the latest mars news, a featured image, mars facts, and pictures of mars. The final page and codes can be found in the Mission_to_Mars_Challenge folder.
